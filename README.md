# go-jose

`go-jose` aims to be a comprehensive JWT, JWS, and JWE implementation

## Why

I needed a complete implementation and I really wanted to like [SermoDigital/jose](https://github.com/SermoDigital/jose) but it was poorly documented, lacking much needed examples, which made it difficult to work with. Other implementations I've found are JWT specific or incomplete.

## Documentation

The documentation is available at [godoc.org](docs)

### [JWS RFC][jws]
### [JWE RFC][jwe]
### [JWT RFC][jwt]
